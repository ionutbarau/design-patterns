Converts an interface of class into another interface clients expect.
Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
It is also known as a Wrapper.
Can be done through multiple inheritance(class adapter) or composition(object adapter).

Is composed of a Target(Shape) that defines the domain specific interface that Client uses.The Client(DrawingEditor)
collaborates with objects conforming to the Target interface. The Adaptee(TextView) defines an existing interface that
needs adapting. The Adapter(TextShape) adapts the interface of Adaptee to the Target interface.
The Client calls operations on the Adapter instance. In turn, the Adapter calls Adaptee operations that carry out the request.

When to use
You want to use an existing class, and it's interface does not match the one you need.
You want to create a reusable class that cooperates with unrelated or unforeseen classes, that is, classes that don't necessarily
have compatible interfaces
You need to use several existing subclasses, but it is impractical to adapt their interface by subclassing every one. An
object adapter can adapt the interface of its parent class.(composition only)
