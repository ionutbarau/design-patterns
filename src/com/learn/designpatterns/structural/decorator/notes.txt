Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to
subclassing for extending functionality.
It is also known as a wrapper.
Encloses a component into another object called Decorator, that provides the same interface the component has and adds additional behavior.
Decorators can nest other decorators recursively.
New behavior can be added or removed at runtime simply by attaching and detaching decorators.

It is composed of a Component (VisualComponent) that defines the interface for objects that can have responsibilities added to them dynamically.
A ConcreteComponent (TextView) defines an object to which additional responsibilities can be attached.
A Decorator(Decorator) maintains a reference to a Component object and defines an interface that conforms to Component's interface(subclasses Component interface).
A ConcreteDecorator (BorderDecorator,ScrollDecorator) adds responsibilities to the component.
Decorator forwards requests to its Component object. It may optionally perform additional operations before and after forwarding the request.

When to use it
1. To add responsibilities to individual objects dynamically and transparently, without affecting other objects.
2. For responsibilities that can be withdrawn
3. When extension by subclassing is impractical. Sometimes a large number of independent extensions are possible and would produce
an explosion of subclasses to support every combination. Or a class definition may be hidden or otherwise unavailable for subclassing.


Related patterns
Decorator is different from adapter in that it changes only object's responsibilities , not it's interface
Decorator can be seen as a degenerate composite with only one component. However a decorator adds additional responsibilities.
It isn't intended for object aggregation.
Decorator let's you change the skin of an object, while strategy let's you change it's guts. They are both 2 alternative
ways of changing an object.
